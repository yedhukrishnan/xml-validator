XML Validator
=============

What is this? Short answer: validates the given XML syntax!

I'm using Lex and Yacc for tokenizing and parsing the XML. I'll be eventually making this into a Ruby gem which can be used in Ruby or Rails applications to validate an XML.

### Tasks List

- [x] First version of tokenizer
- [ ] Create grammar rules for parsing XML syntax
- [ ] Parser for XML
- [ ] Wiki page for tutorial
- [ ] Implementation in Lex and Yacc
