# xml-validator

[work-in-progress]

What is this? Short answer: validates the given XML syntax!

I'm creating this project as part of learning tokenizing and parsing. I may not be following the exact conventions of a tokenizer or parser. Comments and suggestions for improving this are welcome.

I'll be eventually making this into a Ruby gem which can be used in Ruby or Rails applications to validate an XML.

### Tasks List

- [x] First version of tokenizer
- [ ] Create grammar rules for parsing XML syntax
- [ ] Parser for XML
